### Home Page (Timer View)

The main page lets users set the timer duration, select a drink type, and start the timer. As time progresses, the drink depletes to signify the remaining time.

The `TimerView` uses the TimerBloc to manage timer functionality, including start, pause, and reset. It features unique animations for each drink type that change based on user interaction.

### Coffee Cup & Full-Screen Liquid Timer Examples

The app features multiple drink types, each with unique animations that provide a visual representation of your remaining time.
